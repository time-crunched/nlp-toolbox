allowed
the
observation
of

both
in

and
in
the

of

it
was
observed
that
the

wer
completely
damaged

with
the

allowed
to
observ
that

it
is
not
possibl
to
estimat
the
caus
and
origin
of
the
damag
nonetheless
and
based
on
the
assessed
information
damag
show
that
the
failur
is
related
with
a
decompensation
of
the
shaft
transmitted
to
the
generator
causing
a
high
and
violent
shak
of
the

we
highlight
the
