the
measurement
will
be
performed
using

the
equipment
compris
of
a

softwar
as
the

arm
is
brought
the
surfac
to
be
measured
the
placement
of
the
light
diod
is
recorded
and
the
exact
placement
of
the
surfac
is
calculated
the
equipment
typically
has
an
accuracy
of
0.4
mm
each
measured
point
when
the
camer
is
10
