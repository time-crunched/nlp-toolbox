are
pleased
to
submit
our
proposal
on

subject
plant
project
understanding
and
approach
the
hydropow
plant
providenci
hepp
located
in
hidromaul
som
250
km
south
of
santiago
chil
is
owned
and
operated
by
hidromaul
the
plant
consist
of
two
6.2
mw
horizontal
francis
unit
the
electromechanical
suppli
is
andritz
and
the
plant
was
commissioned
in
2012
the

operation
and
in
decemb
2013
norconsult
was
engaged
to
perform
a
sit
visit
and
provid
a
brief
evaluation
of
the
problem
and
suggestion
to
reduc
the
problem
this
brief
evaluation
concluded
that
a
combination
of
hydraulic
design
improvement
including
runn
con
extension
air
suction
and
air
injection
certain

can
improv
the
situation
the
plant
following
the
sit

and
subsequent
conclusion
hidromaul
s.a.
has
requested
a
proposal
from
norconsult
furth
servic
aiming
to
improv
the
situation
the

norconsult
’
s
approach
to
achiev
this
is
to
start
out
by
performing
an
independent
evaluation
of
the
hydraulic
design
using
the
alab™
analysis
softwar
based
on
this
we
will
suggest
possibl
modification
of
the
hydraulic

such
as
design
of
a

modification
may
be
identified
also
the

piec
is
then
to

it

that
air

improv
the
situation
som

and
in
the

of

is
assumed
to
improv
the
situation
furth
in
ord
to
optimiz
the
use
of
air
suction

combined
with
runn

norconsult
will
perform
vibration

on/off
various

norconsult
