chil
we
ref
to
the
recent
email
correspondenc
regarding
providenci
hydroelectric
pow
plant
and
are
pleased
to
submit
our
proposal
on
consulting
servic
subject
plant
project
understanding
and
approach
the
hydropow
plant
providenci
hepp
located
in
hidromaul
som
250
km
south
of
santiago
chil
is
owned
and
operated
by
hidromaul
the
plant
consist
of
two
6.2
mw
horizontal
francis
unit
the
electromechanical
suppli
is
andritz
and
the
plant
was
commissioned
in
2012
the
turbin
experienc
high
vibration
and
nois
part
load
operation
and
in
decemb
2013
norconsult
was
engaged
to
perform
a
sit
visit
and
provid
a
brief
evaluation
of
the
problem
and
suggestion
to
reduc
the
problem
this
brief
evaluation
concluded
that
a
combination
of
hydraulic
design
improvement
including
runn
con
extension
air
suction
and
air
injection
certain
load
can
improv
the
situation
the
plant
following
the
sit
visit
and
subsequent
conclusion
hidromaul
s.a.
has
requested
a
proposal
from
norconsult
furth
servic
aiming
to
improv
the
situation
the
plant
ther
may
be
several
remedi
individually
or
combined
that
can
improv
the
pressur
pulsation
situation
furth
the
basic
principl
is
that
enough
air
need
to
be
added
downstream
of
runn
centr
part
load
to
damp
the
resulting
pressur
pulsation
from
the
part
load
vortex
it
is
already
verified
that
air
suction
improv
the
situation
som
load
through
the
tripod
air
suction
underneath
the
runn
installed
by
andritz
aft
commissioning
in
the
extension
of
this
air
blowing
is
assumed
to
improv
the
situation
furth
besid
in
simil
cas
it
is
oft
prov
favourabl
to
combin
the
air
introduction
with
a
runn
con
extension
and
find
good
a
combination
of
thes
two
through
systematic
testing
and
optimizing
norconsult
’
s
approach
to
achiev
this
is
to
start
out
by
performing
an
independent
evaluation
of
the
hydraulic
design
using
the
alab™
analysis
softwar
based
on
this
we
suggest
possibl
modification
of
the
hydraulic
design
such
as
design
of
a
runn
con
extension
piec
furth
item
modification
may
be
identified
also
the
runn
con
extension
piec
is
then
to
be
produced
locally
in
chil
when
norconsult
is
engaged
in
pressur
pulsation
reduction
effort
plant
such
as
providenci
we
usually
perform
vibration
and
pressur
measurement
to
quantify
and
compar
vibration
and
pressur
pulsation
level
befor
and
aft
installation
of
the
runn
con
extension
combined
with
air
suction
and
injection
on/off
various
load
to
optimiz
the
use
of
air
suction
and
injection
combined
with
runn
con
extension
as
part
of
the
vibration
analysis
norconsult
then
evaluat
the
vibration
and
pressur
pulsation
level
measured
and
compar
with
international
standard
plus
experienc
from
simil
plant
and
acceptabl
level
found
thes
this
systematic
testing
and
optimizing
testing
to
combin
air
and
runn
con
extension
was

in

2014
howev
upon
hidromaul
’
s
request
thes
servic
hav
now
been
removed
from
our
revised
proposal
we
therefor
assum
that
hidromaul
perform
the
testing
and
optimization
required
to
combin
air
and
runn
con
extension
using
own
resourc
not
that
norconsult
can
provid
qualified
advic
and
design
a
runn
con
extension
that
in
theory
should
improv
the
situation
but
we
can
not
guarante
in
advanc
that
the
runn
con
extension
will
solv
the
problem
in
a
few
cas
a
new
runn
with
a
modified
design
has
been
the
only
possibl
solution
also
to
