we
are
pleased
to
off

a
pre-compression
project
a
compressor
packag
of
this
siz
can
not
be
tested
as
a
complet
set
due
to
hug
transport

and
the
fact
that
ther
is

lateral

this
analysis
will
in
principl
be
performed
in
the
sam
way
as
described
in
step
1
but
with
one
major
differenc
the
calculation
of
support
stiffness
one
must
includ
the
whol
skid
including
gear
box
and
compressor
in
the
fem-model
the
fem-model
may
also
hav
to
includ
a
part
of
the
deck
compressor
and
gear
box
can
be
modelled
simplified
as
stiff
box
or
point
mass
rigidly
connected
to
the
skid
a
model
of
the
complet
packag
has
been
built
by
dress
rand
it
should
be
possibl
to
re-us
their
model
but
sinc
norconsult
does
not
use
the
sam
softwar
as
dress
rand
som
work
will
be
needed
to
fix
the
model
it
can
be
used
in
our
softwar
the
rotordynamic
analysis
much
of
the
work
don
in
step
1
can
be
re-used
again
but
it
is
difficult
to
estimat
the
amount
of
work
needed
to
develop
the
fem-model
that
shall
giv
new
valu
calculation
of
effectiv
bearing
stiffness
therefor
this
step
has
to
be
remunerated
on

torsional
analysis
a
separat
torsional
analysis
of
the
compressor
train
can
be
performed
som
of
the
modelling
from
the
lateral
analysis
can
be
re-used
but
the
analysis
also
requir
input
from
dress
rand
regarding
gear

etc
a
