thermodynamic

memo
norconsult

s.a.
is
pleased
to
provid
this
memo
the
thermodynamic
efficiency
measurement
of
unit
1
of
the
antuco
hydro
pow
station
based
on
a
review
of
the
main
plant
drawing
as
well
as
an
inspection
on
sit
and
experienc
from
the

2011
index

it
is
norconsult
's
opinion
that
thermodynamic
measurement
tem
would
be
the
most
accurat
method
measurement
of
absolut
turbin
efficiency
thermodynamic
efficiency
measurement
-tem
general
the
method
is
based
on
measuring
the
total
energy
–
internal
temperatur
and
pressur
kinetic
and
potential
energy
–
entering
and
leaving
the
turbin
the
energy
is
measured
per
unit
mass
of
wat
and
theerfor
the
need

of
turbin
flow
is
eliminated
according
to
the
law
