preliminary
proposal
technical
review
of
bakun
hydroelectric
project
norconsult
has
received
your
request
a
proposal
a
technical
review
on
the
issu
described
bakun
hep
the
information
received
is
limited
this
stag
but
we
hav
tried
to
respond
to
your
request
in
our
best
mann
due
to
the
short
respons
tim
required
and
has
set
up
a
preliminary
proposal
in
our
proposal
the
basic
approach
is
described
but
the
scop
will
hav
to
be
adjusted
togeth
betwe
sarawak

and
norconsult
when

norconsult
will
mak
a

of
the
availabl
documentation
related
to

problem
drawing

commissioning
and
test

etc
based
on
this
we
will
mak
a

we
will
need

sit
inspection
and
measurement
our
basic
concept
is
an
in
depth
investigation
of
the
unit
in
the
worst
operational
condition
the
three
oth
unit
will
be
mor
succinctly
investigated
assuming
that
all
four
unit
are
almost
identical
based
on
the
finding
from
task
1
we
will
mak
a
sit
visit
wher
the
following
will
be
investigated
visual
inspection
of
the
turbin
runn
and
wick
gat
of
one
unit
this
unit
has
to
be
dewatered
secured
and
dried

befor

unit
measurement
of

selected
location
if
possibl
ventilation
and
oth

that
may
hav
influenc
should
be

the
test
will
be
performed
by
using
our

system
which
is
tailor-mad

by
this
we
are
abl
to
perform
preliminary
analysis
on-sit
during
the
testing
and
if
needed
the
test
program
can
be
adjusted
manual

will
be
performed
all

we
will
need
different
load
and
start/stop

the
unit
during
the

typical

will
be
measured
and
evaluated
on
each

are
