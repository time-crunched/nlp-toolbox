regarding

pleas
confirm
the

it
is
listed
as
an
optional

and
does
not
hav
a

we
see
this
item
as
an
important
part
of
the
scop
and
are
concerned
about
cost
if
this

has
not
yet
been
included

you
hav

this
is
the
``

approach
a

although
this
method
is
accurat
enough
in
defining
if
ther
is
a
generator
fault
it
is
not
necessarily
sufficient
to
pin-point
the
exact
location
of
the
fault

on
the
extent
of
the
vibration

may
not
be
abl

wheth

the
ide
behind
the
optional
“

section
is
to
provid
an
elaboration
of
section
1
par
1.2
detailing
the
different
fault
condition
but
with
a
focus
on
the
generator
in
particul
to
mak
sur
that
this
essential
plant
component
is
covered
in
great
detail
to
perform
measurement
to
identify
thes
fault

fault
investigation
using

element
will
be
described
exampl
our
standard
vibration
measurement
can
easily
detect
an
elliptic
shaft
movement
but
if
this
is
caused
by
an
oval
stator
or
by
oval
guid
bearing
may
be
difficult
to
determin
in
such
a
cas
inspection
of
the
guid
bearing
support
with

clearanc
measurement
will
be
recommended
if
thes
investigation

not
produc
reasonabl
answ
to
the
problem
the
stator
ovality
measurement
is
a
possibl
next
step
vibration
due
to
less-than-ideal
design
of
stator

caus
high
frequency
vibration
and
nois
such
issu
may
demand
a
thorough
electrical
calculation
of
the

this
calculation
is
out
of
the
scop
of
a
regul
