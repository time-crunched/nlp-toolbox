this

describ
a
proposed
rotordynamic
evaluation
of
the
new

purpos
of
analysis
the
purpos
of
the
rotordynamic
analysis
is
to
verify
the
rotordynamic
performanc
of
the
new
unit
in
nedr
leirfoss
pow
plant
scop
of
work
sinc
the
unit
nedr
leirfoss
is
a
two-bearing
typ
with
both
bearing
supported
by
the
stator
housing
the
rotordynamic
evaluation
is
mor
complex
than
a
hydropow
unit
with
bearing
braced
individually
against
the
foundation
therefor
a
stepwis
approach
is
suggested
and
