typical

the
graph
below
is
the
result
from
four
of
the
strain
gaug
it
can
be
seen
that
the
friction
is
very
high
although
we
hav
found
that
friction
on
the
left-hand
trunnion
bearing
is
low
by
about
20
than
right

sid

basically
we
are
finding
the
friction
coefficient
is
in
the
rang
of
0.7
to
around
1.1
think
the
poor
location
of
som
of
the

may
account
som
of
the
spurious
result
caus
the
fact
is
that
thes
valu
seem
extraordinary
but
we
hav
not
yet
identified
a
caus
ther
is
sometim
stiction
in
one
bearing
with
a
frequency
of
2
hz
ther
is
historical
evidenc
that
the
problem
was
initially
observed
in
the
1970s
ie
about
10-15
year
aft
completion
of
the
dam
it
could
be
corrosion
betwe
ss
bronz
with
the
graphit
but
the
intrusion
of
moistur
into
the
bearing
is
unlikely
and
the
clearanc
are
extremely
tight
much
clos
than

exampl

we
consid
this
unlikely
error
in

techniqu
a
possibility
but
the

method
appear
to
be
sound
and
ther
are

what

is
not

with
the

we

considering
the
difficulty
of

replacement
of

and
ther
may
be

upgrad
in

or

we
would
pref
to

and

but
we
need
to

a

if
