norconsult
is
pleased
to
off
strain
gag
measurement
bing

ambuklao
turbin
runn
measurement
objectiv
is
to
obtain
information
about
stress
low
load
to
allow
the
oem
’
s
to
investigat
how
extended
operation
in
low
flow
regim
may
affect
expected
lifetim
of
the
runn
compared
to
frequent
start/stop
we
want
to
point
out
that
low
load
operation
increas
the
risk
of
cavitation
and
henc
the
risk
of
destroying
the
strain
gaug
still
our
previous
measurement
hav
been
completed
nearly
without
loss
of
strain
gaug
even
during
low
load
operation
and
multipl
start/stop
cycl
scop

the
turbin
manufactur
each

will
und
a
