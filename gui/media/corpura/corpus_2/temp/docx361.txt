problem
understanding
norconsult
has
got
som
limited
information
of
the
problem
in
e-mail
from
you
dated
18
may
and
25
may
our
first
hypothesis
is
that
the
problem
probably
is
primarily
caused
by
transient
pressur
variation
due
to
valv
open/closur
and
secondary
by
local
flow
condition
in
the
connector/hos
interfac
the
flow
velocity
is
very
high
through
the
system
up
to
19
m/s
during
a
valv
open/clos
operation
the
pressur
transient
waterhamm
can
be
up
to
+/-
2500
psi
combining
the
pressur
transient
with
the
actual
pressur
static
pressur
minus
pressur
drop
can
creat
hos
collaps
and
ruptur
we
will
suggest
the
following
approach
review
of
the
actual
hydraulic
system
configuration
and
operation
perform
a
dynamic
analysis
of
the
main
hydraulic
system
including
valv
opening/clos
and
the
effect
of
accumulator
in
the
system
this
calculation
has
to
be
``
calibrated
''
against
availabl
pressur
measurement
the
calculation
will
be
abl
to
detect
local
``
low
pressur
pock
''
in
the
system
perform
a
cfd
calculation
of
the
flow
condition
in
the
connector/hos
