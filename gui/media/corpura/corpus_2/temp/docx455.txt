norconsult
is
pleased
to
provid
this
proposal
strain
gaug
measurement
on
one
pelton
runn
in
bhutan
the
purpos
of
the
test
is
to
measur
the
mechanical
stress
in
the
runn
during
operation

one
exper
from
norconsult
will
install
the
strain

and
perform
the
measurement
plant

mechanical
assistanc
will
also
be
needed
from
the
plant
operator
to
assist
during
cleaning
and
installation
of
the
strain
gaug
only
ordinary
mechanical
skill
are
needed
our
proposal
includ
measuring
strain
in
one
direction
up
to
12
different
location
on
the
runn
the
location
of
the
strain
gaug
hav
to
be
decided
by
andritz
hydro
based
on
their
finit
element
analysis
but
the
installation
must
be
feasabl
with
respect
to
the
siz
of
the
strain
gaug
and
allowabl
surfac
curvatur
the
installation
location
the
strain
gaug
with
cabling
will
be
covered
with
watertight
epoxy
to
protect
them
from
humidity
and
flow
forc
the
cabling
will
be
connected
to
a
12-channel
waterproof
dat
logg
fixed
to
the
shaft
end
the
dat
logg
has
integrated
strain
gaug
amplifi
battery
pack
and
a

the
logg
can
mak
continuous

1.8
hour
with
a
sampling
rat
of
1613
samples/second/channel
if
it
is
required
by
the
custom
two

may
be
carried
out
with
12
