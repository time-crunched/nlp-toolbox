about
turbin
efficiency
test
method
we
propos
to
divid
the
training
in
two
part
one
theoretical
and
one
practical
part
in
the
first
part
the
necessary
theoretical
foundation
is
giv
and
in
the
second
part
ther
will
be
a
hands-
on
practical
training
in
a
pow
plant
or
university
facility
the
goal
this
training
is
that
the
staff
should
be
abl
to
perform
a
simpl
index
test
on
a
